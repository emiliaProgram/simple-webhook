## Introduction

A webhook is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page or web application with custom callbacks. These callbacks may be maintained, modified, and managed by third-party users and developers who may not necessarily be affiliated with the originating website or application.

In this example, we will set up a basic webhook receiver and a webhook sender to demonstrate how to send and receive webhook events.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Usage

### Starting the Webhook Receiver

Navigate to the `webhook-receiver` directory and run the server:

```bash
npm install express body-parser
node index.js
```

This will start the webhook receiver on `http://localhost:3000/webhook`.

### Sending a Webhook

Navigate to the `webhook-sender` directory and run the script to send a webhook:

```bash
npm install axios
npm install crypto
node sendWebhook.js
```

This will send a POST request to the webhook receiver with the specified payload and signature.

## Testing the Webhook

1. Start the webhook receiver.
2. Send the webhook using the sender script.
3. Observe the output in the receiver's console to verify that the webhook was received and processed correctly.

## Security Considerations

- Use a strong and unique shared secret for HMAC signature verification.
- Validate all incoming webhook data to ensure it comes from a trusted source.
- Consider implementing additional security measures such as IP whitelisting and rate limiting.
